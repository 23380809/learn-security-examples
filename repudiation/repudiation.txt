- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
Repudiation is the act of denying that an event occurred. In the context of web applications,
repudiation can occur when a user denies that they performed a particular action, such as making a purchase or sending a message. This can be a problem for web applications, as it can lead to disputes between users and the application owner.


- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
To prevent repudiation attacks, web applications can incorporate additional security mechanisms 
such as logging and digital signatures.
